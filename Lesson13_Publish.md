# Publish Your Thing
## Objectives:
* Publish a customizable project to Thingiverse

The final step is to get your project up on the Thingiverse and get the customizer running. You will probably need to do some debugging and upload the files a few times; that's pretty normal.

  1. Create an STL and a PNG of your design in OpenSCAD; this will give you a nice image to share
    - F6 to Render
    - File > Export > Export as STL
    - File > Export > Export as Image
  2. Sign in to your Thingiverse account and choose 'Create > Upload a Thing'
  3. Drag or Browse to upload your STL, PNG and SCAD file for your project
    - Drag the thumbnails to organize the images in the order that suits you
  4. Give your project a catchy name that is descriptive but short
  5. Select a category. This fits well under Art > Signs and Logos
  6. Choose a license. This project was originally distributed under the CC Atrrib-Share-Alike license. It would be best to share this project under the same license as that is keeping in the spirit of the Creative Commons and the original author's (my) wishes.
  7. Tick the 'This is a Remix' box because you derived this from someone else's project
    - In the box below you can specify the project this was derived from (1201466)
    - This helps others see the lineage of the project and locate other users that are working on similar projects.
    - This is also nice for me because I get a little notice every time someone uses my work. It's like a little tip in my jar, but I can't spend it.  It just makes me feel good.
  8. **Tick 'This is a Customizer'** to make sure this project is customizable.
  9. Add one or two sentences summary that explains what this project is all about
  10. If you would like to add any other instructions or notes you can use the Design section and the custom sections.  This is not necessary, but can be nice.
  11. Save and view your project.
    -Now's the time to test the customizer.
    -Make sure the customizer options appear as you expect. Make sure that things work like you hope.
    -If you need to make changes, edit the project and remove the SCAD file. Replace it with a revised version and then repeat step 11 as needed.
  12. Publish your thing using the link at the top of the page and share it with all your friends.

Congratulations! You've just created your first customizable, parametric project and shared
 it on Teh Intertubes!

## Closing
Thanks for making it this far. I hope you found this text useful and feel more confident using OpenSCAD and making parametric designs.

The next step is to download other people's libraries and SCAD projects and play with them. You can learn more from experimenting with other projects than I can teach you here. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to contact the person who created a project. Most authors will be thrilled to hear from someone who found their project useful. The urge to share ideas and learn from others is why most authors publish their works in places like the Thingiverse.

If you have any questions or comments for me please don't hesitate to contact me either through the Thingiverse or via email. I am happy to answer questions and would love to fix any mistakes you find.
