# License Your Thing

## Objectives:
* Create an account on thingiverse
* Become familiar with Copyright licenses
* Choose an appropriate copyright license for this project

The final step in this is to upload your project to Thingiverse so other people can play with it, improve on it and share their work. There are a few things you will need to do before you can share this project.
* [Create an account](https://accounts.thingiverse.com/register?)
* Choose a License

Creating an account should be pretty self-explanitory. If you want to skip this step, continue on for some last little tid-bits.

Here's a really interesting fact about Copy Right. You already have it. Once you hit the save key, you created a piece of work that can be copyrighted. The act of creation is all it takes. You have the sole right to decide who will use your work and how it will be used. Most of the stuff you see on the Thingiverse is copyrighted, but copyrighted in such a way that preserves the creators reputation, but allows anybody to make stuff and have fun with it. This is done through chosing a license that matches how you feel about your work.

Is your work super secret and the basis of your billion dollar business plan? Don't share it! Keep that to your self! Or is your work a good idea based on the good ideas of all those that have come before you? Or something in between? How would you feel about someone using your idea to make something new? How would you feel about someone profiting from your work? Once you've answered those questions the next steps should be easy.

Take a look at the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license page and see which license works best for you. There's a nice little 3 minute video that explains the basics of the licenses.

Choosing a license is not complex, but does require a bit of thought. This set of lessons that you have been reading is released under the Creative Commons Attribute-Share-Alike License. This means that if you want to publish your own version of the sliding top box or the name tag you should give me credit and you need to share your designs under the same terms, allowing others to modify and share the work as well. It also means that you can't sell the design. You are welcome to make real objects based on the design and sell them, but you can not take credit for the designs and sell those as your own.

Giving credit is as simple as providing a user name, or an email address somewhere in your project. When you share your project on Thingiverse, or any other web site, you should also mention that your project is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribute-Share-Alike license so other people know where it came from.

Thingiverse also provides GPL licenses and BSD license. These are more specific and apply more to software than creative works, but can be applied to almost anything.

Because this project was originally released under the CC Share-Alike license, you really should choose the same license. I won't hunt you down and point a loaded lawyer at you, but I might give you a hard time if I come across one of your designs that is licensed in a more restrictive way.

## Questions:
* Why would you bother to copyright your work at all?
* Why should you respect the copyright of other's work?
* Which license did you choose for this project? Why? Hint: there are only a few right answers to this questions.
* Which license is best for work that you intend to share with the community?
